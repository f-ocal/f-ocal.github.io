      <h2>Margin, Border, and Padding</h2>
        The spacing-out elements such as margin, border and paddington can be easily viewed and changed within the panel. Margin is the spacing outside of something and padding is the spacing inside of something. The border helps you increase the space inside a visible box. In the Box Model, you will have an element surrounding that you have padding, then surrounding with the border, and surrounding with the margin. The differences between padding and margin is that margins auto-collapse; however padding doesn't. This can be very useful for the spacing between elements.The other differences is that padding is included within the click-region and background color/image.<br>

      <h2>Relative, Absolute, Fixed, and Static Positioning</h2>
      <span style = "background-color: #f8f8f8;font-weight:bold ">Absolute positioning</span> lets you determine an element's location by specifying left, right, top and bottom position in pixel, ems or percentages, whoes computed position property is absolute. Absolute positioning allows you to remove an object from the typical flow of the document and place it at a specific point on the page. Absolutely positioned elements are completely detached from the flow of the page, thus takes up no space when placing other elements. Absolute behaves like fixed except the absolute positioned element is positioned relative to nearest positioned ancestor(no statis). If an absolutely position element has no position ancestors or if parent element is position static, the abosultely-positioned child would escape, it will use the document body and move out as you scroll the page up and down. Note that even if there were other content occupying this absolute position, the absolute positioned element would not care. When something has absolute positioning applied, it neither affects nor is affected by other elements in the normal flow of the page.<br>
      <br><span style = "background-color: #f8f8f8;font-weight:bold">Fixed positioning</span>  is that an element is locked into place on the screen. When you scroll the page, fixed elements remain onscreen as photos, paragraphs disappear. Fixed elements are great to creat a fixed side bar or lock a navigation bar to the top or bottom of the page. (versus Static content scrolls with the page).<br>
      <br><span style = "background-color: #f8f8f8;font-weight:bold">Static positioning</span>  simply means the content follows the normal top-down flow of HTML. The default position value for any element on the page is 'static'. An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way. A static element is said to be not 'positioned', 'positioned' element means its position is set to anything except static.<br>
      <br><span style = "background-color: #f8f8f8;font-weight:bold">Relative positioning</span>  is that the relatively positioned element is placed relative to its current position in the HTML flow. Setting the top, right, bottom and left properties of a relatively positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Unlike with absolute positioning, other page elemets accommodate the old HTML placement of a relatively positioned element. Notice that, just as with absolute positioning, the relatively positioned object doesn't care about other items in the normal flow of the page. However, moving an element with relative positioning leaves a "hole" where the element would have been.
