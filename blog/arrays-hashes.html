    <h2>Array and Hashes</h2>
    <h3><strong style="color:red">Array</strong></h3>
    <p>As Ruby is completely object-oriented, arrays and hashes are the containers object to hold the collection of objects.
      An array's job is to store other objects including other arrays, hashes, classes, integers, strings and true and false .. any object. Arrays in Ruby are the storage that holds ordered lists of objects. They are written a single row of variable length. Ruby allows you retrieve information from an array, you can modify or even insert data to an array.
    </p>An array can be created in following ways:
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Array.new() method</strong></li>
        The method of new() is usual way, additionally it also can help to specify the size of the array.
        While indicating the size of the array, the contents of the array can be can be set.
        <div class="code-block"><code>a = Array.new() </code> ==> creates an empty array, return value will be [].
        <br><code>a = Array.new(3)</code> ==> allows you specify the size of the array to 3, all of three elements are set to nil.
        <br><code>a = Array.new(4, "hello") </code>==> also allows you to initialize its contents. All of four elements of the array will be assigned to "hello"
      </div>
      </p>
      <li><strong>Literal Constructor</strong></li>Creating an array by using square brackets []
      <div class="code-block"><code>a=[]</code> ==> creating an array with square brackets.
      <br><code>a= [1,2,"three", "a", "b",[5,3,10]]</code> ==> you can also initialize the contents of the array within the brackets. You can nest another arrays within an array.
    </div>
    </ol>
    To access the elements of the array by referencing index numbers. The first element is positioned at "0", second element is at "1".. such as
    <div class="code-block">
    <code>a= [1,2,"three", "a", "b",[5,3,10]]</code>
    <br><code>a=[2]</code> ==> "three" and <code>a=[5]</code> ==> [5,3,10]</div>

    <h3><strong style="color:red">Hashes</strong></h3>
    Hash is a collection of objects like arrays except that each element contains a pair of "key and value". For instance, if we want to store the phone numbers of friends, than hashes would be the great way to store both the name of person and the number. Hashes also provide to lookup operations based on keys. Hashes also remember their key-insertion order and observe the order when you iterate over them.
  </p>Hashes can be created in following ways:
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Hash.new() method </strong></li>Creating an empty hash
    <div class="code-block"><code>h = Hash.new() </code> ==> creates an empty hash! When you ask for the value for non-existing key, it returs `nil`.
    <br><code>h = Hash.new(0)</code> ==> assigns hash default value to 0. When you call for a key that doesn't exist, it returns the default value of `0`.  </div>

    <br><li><strong>Literal Constructor { } </strong></li>Creating a hash by using curly braces { } ~very popular way~
      <div class="code-block"><code>h={}</code> ==> creating an empty hash.</div>

    <br><li><strong>The Hash.[] and h = { "key" => "value"}</strong></li>Creating a hash by using square brackets, this method takes comma-separated list of items. !!!
      <br><code>h.["New York", "NY", "San Francisco", "SF"]</code> ==> This will mapped to a key/value pairs as per following <br>
      <code>h = {"New York" => "NY", "San Francisco" => "SF"}</code> ==> This is also another way to create hashes by giving key and values!!!<br>

    <br><li><strong>Defining keys with symbols </strong></li>Both following ways are quite similar to each other. You can either assign <strong>`key`</strong> after symbol <strong>`:`</strong> and followed by <strong>`=>`</strong> sign or you can assign <strong>`key`</strong> and follow with symbol <strong>`:`</strong>, and then assign them to <strong>`values`</strong> inside quotation marks.
    <br><code>h=[:new_york => "NY", :year => "2015"]</code> ==> This will generate a new hash by giving key/value pairs.
    <br><code>h=[new_york: "NY", year: "2015"]</code> ==> This is also another way to create hash by giving key/value pairs.
