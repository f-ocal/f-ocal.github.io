      <h2>Technical Blog - 2 </h2>
      Our economy is highly driven by technology and innovation. Many industries are changing rapidly through the application of advanced tech.In order to stay globally competitive within current technology era, companies should optimize the use of the technology, constantly innovates and leverages diversity of talent. As clearly can be seen among many surveys that many companies are not doing well with the criteria of diversity. Especially Silicon Valley has got a lot of attention for its lack of diversity. Google, for the first time has revealed their diversiy statistics last year. The ratio has shown that their 70% of employees are male. Why hasn't this ratio made up to 70% of women? Is the problem woman or tech companies? I think it is both, even more the society has impact on it, too.

      Fistly, let's crack the benefits of having diversity within an organization. As Ruth Porat, Google CFO, says on the article <a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/google-cfo-hiring-women-is-good-for-business/">here</a>, she explains how tech companies should help to open more doors for women and minorities. She highlights that having more diversity is the right thing to do for you business. What is good of having more woman in your business is that most of the projects are track on schedule with low costs. In my opinion, the more diverse workforce can bring different ideas, thoughts, and opinions to your business. Also, team with balanced woman is more creative and stay on the tasks within the project schedule. We should also give credits to women's outstanding skills for being so good at multitasking.<p>

      After giving the brief summary of diversity benefits, there won't be any changes as long as we value the diversity and implemented it within the organisations. How can we encourage more woman and minorities to join into the tech industry? Here is my solutions that would have impact and increase the diversity.


      If we want more diversity in the exposure to the technology, we need to introduce technology, Entreprenuership at young age.
