      <h2>Diversity in Tech Industry</h2>
      Our economy is highly driven by technology and innovation. Many industries are changing rapidly through the application of advanced tech.In order to stay globally competitive within current technology era, companies should optimize the use of the technology, constantly innovates and leverages diversity of talent. As clearly can be seen among many surveys that many companies are not doing well with the criteria of diversity. Especially Silicon Valley has got a lot of attention for its lack of diversity. Google, for the first time has revealed their diversiy statistics last year. The ratio has shown that their 70% of employees are male. Why hasn't this ratio made up to 70% of women? Is the problem woman or tech companies? I think it is both, even more the society has impact on it, too.
      <p>
      Fistly, let's crack the benefits of having diversity within an organization. As Ruth Porat, Google CFO, says on the article <a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/google-cfo-hiring-women-is-good-for-business/">here</a>, she explains how tech companies should help to open more doors for women and minorities. She highlights that having more diversity is the right thing to do for you business. What is good of having more woman in your business is that most of the projects are track on schedule with low costs. In my opinion, the more diverse workforce can bring different ideas, thoughts, and opinions to your business. Also, team with balanced woman is more creative and stay on the tasks within the project schedule. We should also give credits to women's outstanding skills for being so good at multitasking.</p>

      After giving the brief summary of diversity benefits, there won't be any changes as long as we value the diversity and implemented it within the organisations. How can we encourage more woman and minorities to join into the tech industry and how can we encourage companies to hire more women and minorities?
      <br>Here is some of my solutions that would have impact and increase the diversity in the tech industry.
      <ul>
        ** Encourage more women and minorities to join to STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) industries.<br>
        ** Companies should acknowledge their lack of diversity and introduce customised programs. The companies should do an assessment of culture of the organisation including discrimination in pay and hiring practices, they should offer mandatory trainings for every employees.<br>
        ** Companies should develop career paths that helps them to see the potentional opportunities. Without clearly defined plan, employees will loose interest and leave the company.<br>
        * Provide comfort and support for women such as providing more flexible work arrangements, supportive work environments, salary with consideration of childcare expenses.<br>
        ** Develop specific mentor programs and coaching for women and minorities on soft skills, such as building relationship,networking, negotiation, increase their self-esteem and awareness making sure that their creditiability and influence matters to the company.<br>
        ** If we want more diversity in the exposure to the technology, we need to introduce technology, Entreprenuership at young age. I believe there should be more collaborations between educational institutions, academics, businesses and tech industry. As searched, there is a non-profit organization called, <a href="https://code.org/">Code.org</a> is doing great job to teach our kids how to code and encourage them to expose to the technology.</ul>

      What we need is more companies like Code.org and a new kind of economic development, an approach that brings together businesess to provide students with internship at tech companies, create mentoring and leadership opportunities. By increasing awareness of the lack of diversity in tech and STEM fields, organisations should address the objective of the diversity and its benefits to the organisation nd to individuals. It is time for organisation provide more opportunities to women and minorities to thrieve in the workplace.<br>
