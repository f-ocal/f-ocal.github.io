      <p><li>Version Control</li><br>Version control system is a repository of files that keeps revisions of the modifications and changes. When developers writes codes, they often make a lot of changes to the code so there will be many versions. So programmers/developers can download these versions as they need or upload the latest codes. By this, every programmer can contribute to the project, it also helps them to collaborate easily. If you ever need to go back to the old version of any project, you can easily roll back to an earlier project.
     </p>


      <p><li>Git</li><br>Git is an open-source fast version control that is used to store information. Whenever there is a change within the file, Git saves the state of your information by taking snapshots of all files status at that moment and provides a history of content changes. Git ensures the integrity of the content and stores the snapshots of file changes. Each time you make a change, Git takes the snapshot of the change within the file, and store it with a reference number. You can easily go back to the previous stage with this reference number. In GitHub, all of the changes can be found with a command of "git log".</p>


        <p><li>Github</li><br>Github is a web-based Git repository hosting service that allows to store projects and to manipulate the codes. Programmers store projects and collaborate with likeminded people through Github. Public repositories such as files/codes can be browsed and downloaded by anyone. It is like a social code sharing for programmers through network. Github provides web-based graphical interfaces along with task management. It allows storing the versions of the projects, files.It is open source so developers don't need to pay anything to upload or downdload their version of files. Github provides opportunity for startups to start working on the project and collaborate with team members with zero operation costs unless they want to pay premium.</p>
