<!--
1. How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

   Both of us using same wireframe tool which made it easier to create wireframe. It was a good collaboration that we communicated a lot and work through on each tasks together.

2. Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

  It was definitely helpful, and great to have some sort of layout to set the basic structures begin starting the writing HTML codes.

3. What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

   We kept the wireframe very simple and easy to put the wireframe into code. As it was very simple, therefore we both easily adapt the wireframe into the different ideas.

4. What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ?
